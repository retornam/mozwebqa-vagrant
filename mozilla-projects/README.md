# Mozilla WebQA Projects

All your Mozilla projects that you will clone in the VM will be made available
to you in this directory so that you can use your favourite IDE or text editor
and work with ease.

This directory will be available in `/home/vagrant/mozilla-projects` when you
SSH into the VM using `vagrant`.
